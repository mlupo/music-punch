# music-punch
A project in MicroyPython which controls the artwork "Just Another Beep Boop Machine"

This project was a small experiment in creating music in a simple and interactive way: the user punches cards, and feeds them into the machine. The device then reads the open holes, and plays the corresponding note.

This code is written for an [Espruino Pico]{http://www.espruino.com/Pico}, which has been flashed with [MicroyPython]{http://micropython.org/} (a process I detail [here]{http://maxlupo.com/installing-micropython-on-the-espruino-pico/}).
